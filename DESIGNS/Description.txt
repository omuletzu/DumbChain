RandomChain, its like a social media app, where each user can start a chain of 3 types, story chain, random chain or chainllange. User sets a theme and a title and starts the chain, and what he writes there is send to another user (random or friend) and so on each user contributing to that chain till a number of chain contributors is gained. After this, this chains are made public and every person can see them, and if something is wrong with that chain it can be reported. Each user can make friends, explore all users and block or report users. He can see his profile and by contributing to each chain he gains some points (and he get some ranks based on that points). He can like or save that chains, and each user can see each others profile and chains that they contributed. Also user can start or stop notifications and he can set dark mode on or off. Also he can modify his profile photo, name or nationality. Users sign up or in using phone number, or email and password or google account. Users can search for public chains by tags and can search users by their nicknames
